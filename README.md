## Parametric Surface Reconsctruction from Point Cloud using Creo Toolkit (Creo Parametric)
Work in Progress for paper submission: **Feature Reconstruction Methods in Point Clouds with Applications in Creo Parametric**.<br>

This is a self contained Visual Studio Project that builds the plugins using the libraries needed. The only thing needed is to set in the environmental variables the Creo Toolkit Path in the variable *PROTOOL_SRC*. Usually this path is in the directory C:\Program Files\PTC\. For example,  see the image below:<br>
![Environmental Variable](https://github.com/agalex1974/CreoSurfaceReconstructionFromPC/blob/main/ReadMeImages/2.jpg?raw=true) <br>
After setting this environmental variable the code should be able to compile and build by selecting the ReleaseOpenMP option in the build settings.
